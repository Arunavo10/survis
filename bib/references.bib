  abstract = { Having a good grasp on modelling the dynamics of occupants for estimating electricity consumption in office buildings is a vital asset for realistic predictions. Nowadays, agent-based models are widely used for this purpose. Previous approaches to modelling dynamics of occupants in multi-floor office buildings simplified the models by teleporting agents between zones during transitions without considering the routes used to reach their final destination such as going through corridors, stairways and hallways, thus, underestimating the potential energy usage during those transition period. This paper proposes a more realistic approach by incorporating detailed routes of agent movement when transiting from one zone to another. To demonstrate the case, detailed routes and route choice preferences are used as inputs within the model for the agents to make independent decisions when transiting from one place to another within the simulated office building. The route choice preferences are computed from data gained from an earlier extensive real world occupancy detection trial conducted within the model office building using state of the art indoor positioning system. The simulation experiments compare the previous approach against the proposed approach and based on the evaluation it is found that there is approximately 19% underestimation of electricity consumption per day when detailed routes are not considered. The research demonstrates, the proposed approach is applicable to any office buildings and will produce predictions which will be much more realistic and closer to the real world electricity consumption level.},

A growing research community is active in the development and validation of stochastic models addressing these issues; and considerable progress has been made. Specifically models in the areas of presence, activities while present, shading devices, window openings and lighting usage.},

  abstract = {Assessing building performance related to energy consumption in post-design-occupancy stage requires knowledge of building occupancy pattern. These occupancy data can potentially be collected from trials and used to improve the prediction capability of building performance models. Due to the limitations of passive sensors in detecting an individual’s occupancy throughout the building, indoor positioning can provide a viable alternative. Previous work on using indoor positioning techniques for detecting building occupancy mainly focused on passive monitoring through Wi-Fi or BLE proximity sensing by estimating the number of occupants at any given time. This paper extends our previous research and demonstrates the merit of occupancy monitoring through active tracking at an individual level using a smartphone-based multi-floor indoor positioning system. The paper discusses the design of a novel occupancy detection trial setup, mimicking real-world office occupancy and discusses the outcome of the ecologically valid trials using the developed positioning system. In total 50 occupancy trials were carried out by around 22 participants comprising of a variety of routes within the building. The trial results are presented to demonstrate the level of accuracy achievable against a specific set of the performance metric necessary for building occupancy detection and modelling.},

  abstract = { Maximizing energy conservation, improving energy efficiency and integration and control of renewable energy sources are critical in order to achieve a low carbon future. An integrated modelling system is needed to evaluate and improve energy performance of urban energy systems’ design and operation, from both financial and environmental perspectives.
To this end, this paper presents an urban energy co-simulation framework. It is based on co-simulation standard Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) and CityGML-based semantic 3D city model and utilized programing packages, like PyFMI, FMILibrary, and mosaik, which is capable of orchestrating the execution of dynamic simulation models supporting the for co-simulation. To demonstrate the proof of concept, two simulation tools are coupled in the first instance: EnergyPlus and No-MASS. Based on the two use cases, the principles and workflow of the framework and results from its application are described. Results from use cases show that synchronization and interaction between our urban energy co-simulation framework and coupled co-simulation components works as intended. The paper concludes by discussing strategies to tackle more complex and multiscale energy systems.},

@article { Zakhary & Siebers ,
  abstract = { The micro-simulation of buildings’ energy performance at the urban scale entails the dynamic simulation of buildings’ energy demands in a spatially resolved way; and of the supply of energy to meet these demands. Two approaches have emerged to meet the increasingly important need for such simulations: repeated calls to detailed dynamic simulation software that was designed for simulating single buildings, or a single call to simplified dynamic simulation software that was designed for simulating arbitrary numbers of buildings simultaneously. In this paper we describe a workflow that is under development to support application of the latter approach at multiple scales, ranging from single buildings, through neighbourhoods, to districts and whole cities. This approach is based on CitySim, which remains to our knowledge the most comprehensive dedicated urban energy micro-simulation software. This workflow focuses on the utilisation by CitySim of an emerging standard for the semantic attribution of 3D urban models called CityGML, the import and export of CityGML files from a 3D database called 3DCityDB, methods for the population of this database, and on the generalisation of CitySim to solve for scenes of different spatial extent and level of detail. This paper describes this new workflow and its potential application to the simulation of urban scenes of varying complexity, from a simple street canyon to an urban district. This workflow is to represents our first step in the development of an integrated urban modelling platform for the simulation of physical resource flows and the socioeconomic phenomena that influence them.},

  abstract = {This research investigated the simulation model behaviour of a traditional and combined discrete event as well as agent based simulation models when modelling human reactive and proactive behaviour in human centric complex systems. A departmental store was chosen as human centric complex case study where the operation system of a fitting room in WomensWear department was investigated. We have looked at ways to determine the efficiency of new management policies for the fitting room operation through simulating the reactive and proactive behaviour of staff towards customers. Once development of the simulation models and their verification had been done, we carried out a validation experiment in the form of a sensitivity analysis. Subsequently, we executed a statistical analysis where the mixed reactive and proactive behaviour experimental results were compared with some reactive experimental results from previously published works. Generally, this case study discovered that simple proactive individual behaviour could be modelled in both simulation models. In addition, we found the traditional discrete event model performed similar in the simulation model output compared to the combined discrete event and agent based simulation when modelling similar human behaviour.},
